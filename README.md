# SpotifyAnalysis

Welcome to my Spotify Data Analysis project! In this repository, you'll find code to extract, analyze, and visualize data from Spotify using web scraping techniques.

## About the Project ℹ️

This project aims to gather insights into music trends, artist popularity, and album statistics on Spotify. By leveraging web scraping tools and Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Plotly, we extract data directly from the Spotify web interface and generate interactive visualizations.

## Features 🚀

- **Artist Search**: Retrieve Spotify artist information including albums, singles, and popularity.
- **Album Analysis**: Gather data on album tracks, release dates, and popularity ratings.
- **Data Visualization**: Create interactive plots to visualize popular tracks, album durations, and more.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify and extend the code to suit your specific data analysis needs.

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Update the `client_id` and `client_secret` variables in the code with your Spotify API credentials.
4. Run the Python script `spotify_analysis.py` to start the data extraction and analysis process.
5. Explore the generated visualizations and insights!
